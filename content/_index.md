## Welcome!

I am a PhD student in the Department of Economics and the Fletcher School of of Law and Diplomacy, Tufts University.

My research interest mainly falls in the intersection of environmental economics and development economics, with a focus on (a) technology adoption and social network, (b) environmental impacts (externalities) of policies in developing countries, (c) enforcement of environmental regulations and associated corruption.

I love to practice yoga (especially Sivananda yoga) and see contemporary arts.
