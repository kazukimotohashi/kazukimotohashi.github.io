I am an Assistant Professor in the Graduate School of Economics at Hitotsubashi University. I received my PhD in Economics and Public Policy from Tufts University in 2023.

My research interests are in environmental economics and development economics, with a focus on environmental pollution and health in developing countries. My work mainly draws on geospatial analysis of environmental data and field surveys in India and Bangladesh.
